            LogRocket is a frontend application monitoring solution that lets you
            replay problems as if they happened in your own browser. Instead of
            guessing why errors happen, or asking users for screenshots and log
            dumps, LogRocket lets you replay the session to quickly understand what
            went wrong. It works perfectly with any app, regardless of framework, and
            has plugins to log additional context from Redux, Vuex, and @ngrx/store.
