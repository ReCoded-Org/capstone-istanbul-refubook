        "<h2> نبذة تاريخية عن Mozilla </h2>",
        "تم إنشاء Mozilla من رماد أحد أكثر إخفاقات البرامج إثارة في العالم. لقد تحولت Netscape Navigator , الشركة الرائدة في مجال مستعرضات الويب في أواخر التسعينيات , من شركة الإنترنت إلى التشغيل أيضًا في غضون أشهر. السبب - Microsoft التجميع القوي لـ Internet Explorer - بالكاد يبدو عادلاً. ولكن معظم مراقبي الصناعة استسلموا لمستقبل تكون فيه المتصفحات مجانية ومنتشرة في كل مكان. كانت بالكاد منتجًا يمكنك بناء شركة حوله. ",
        "بعد ذلك , وبضربة صغيرة من العبقرية , أنشأت Netscape منظمة Mozilla غير الربحية (التي أعيدت تسميتها لاحقًا باسم Mozilla Foundation) لتطوير مجموعة تطبيقات المتصفحات والبريد والمحادثة المتكاملة من Netscape. انهارت مبادرة البرنامج هذه ببطء في مواجهة المنافسين الذين لديهم المزيد من المال والمزيد الوصول. ولكن في السنوات التالية , تحولت مؤسسة Mozilla إلى نوع مختلف من المنظمات - مؤسسة مكرسة لتعزيز معايير الويب المفتوحة ومحو الأمية على الويب. (ناهيك عن حفنة من المبادئ ذات الطابع اليوتوبي المنصوص عليها في بيان Mozilla الشهير. ) ",
        "بعد سنوات , أعادت مجموعة من مطوري Mozilla تشغيل جهود المستعرض الخاصة بهم باستخدام Firefox , وقاموا بتقسيمها إلى شركة منفصلة مملوكة بالكامل لا تزال تمول مؤسسة Mozilla حتى يومنا هذا. لو ظلت هذه التقنيات مغلقة مع AOL (الشركة التي اشترت Netscape) , فقد ماتوا منذ سنوات , بسبب الرياح المتغيرة لأزياء الإنترنت. في الواقع , حتى AOL تخلت عن البرنامج الذي حصلت عليه مع Netscape , وتحولت إلى Internet Explorer قبل فترة وجيزة من الانزلاق إلى غير ذي صلة. ",
        "<h2> أفضل أغاني موزيلا </ h2>",
        "Firefox هو أشهر ابتكارات Mozilla. وعلى الرغم من أنه من السهل اليوم استبعاده على أنه مجرد متصفح بديل , إلا أن Firefox الأول كان رائدًا في أدوات حظر الإعلانات وخصوصية البيانات والمطورين. (قبل وجود Chrome DevTools , كان هناك Firebug .) ",
        "إذا كان هذا هو كل ما في Mozilla , لكانت الشركة مجرد مطب سرعة آخر في طريقها إلى هيمنة Chromium و WebKit على العالم. بدلاً من ذلك , طورت Mozilla بعضًا من أهم تقنيات الويب اليوم. إليك أربعة من أفضل مبادراتها.",
        "<h2> 1. الصدأ </ h2>",
        "عندما انهار Netscape , أدرك القليلون أن أهم مساهماته كانت لغة البرمجة النصية الصغيرة الضعيفة التي تركتها وراءها. تلك اللغة كانت JavaScript.",
        "تم إنشاء JavaScript في فترة وجيزة سيطر فيها Netscape على الويب. ولكن في العقدين الماضيين منذ فشل Netscape , أصبحت JavaScript أكثر انتشارًا وهيمنة. لذلك ليس من الصعب تخيل أن أهم ابتكار تركه Firefox وراءه قد يكون لغة الصدأ الآمنة والآمنة. ",
        "يمتد جاذبية Rust عبر الممر. المطورون الذين يعتقدون أن C ++ متساهلة للغاية ومعرضة للخطأ يحبون Rust. لكن المطورين الذين يعتقدون أن لغات OOP التقليدية ثقيلة وغير فعالة أيضًا يحبون Rust. وعلى الرغم من اعتمادها المنخفض نسبيًا , فقد كان Rust تم تصنيفها باعتبارها لغة البرمجة الأكثر شعبية في استطلاع مطور Stack Overflow كل عام منذ عام 2016. ",
        "للأسف , لم تعد المساهمة في لغة Rust أولوية بالنسبة إلى Mozilla الجديدة. في الجولة الأخيرة من عمليات التسريح , قطعوا مطوري Rust المخصصين وفريق Servo الذين سعوا لبناء محرك متصفح جديد يعمل بنظام Rust. ولكن الإجماع هو أن Rust لن ينزل مع السفينة. التخطيط لمؤسسة Rust المستقلة قيد التنفيذ بالفعل. ",
        "<h2> 2. HTML5 </h2>",
        "من الصعب تذكر ذلك , ولكن كان هناك وقت كان فيه العالم محاصرًا في معركة قبيحة بين HTML و XHTML , وهو إصدار غير متوافق مع الإصدارات السابقة من HTML تمت إعادة تخيله باستخدام البنية الأكثر صرامة لـ XML. وكانت HTML تخسر. في عام 2004 , هيئة المعايير المسؤولة عن HTML (W3C) أوقفت رسميًا جميع الأعمال على HTML. ",
        "كانت القصة ستنتهي هناك , لولا WHATWG , وهي مجموعة مخصصة سرعان ما تم تجميعها معًا بواسطة Apple و Opera و Mozilla. الباقي هو التاريخ - فاز WHATWG , وأجبر W3C على تغيير مساره , وأطلق كومة المعايير الجديدة تحت مظلة HTML5 , بما في ذلك الفيديو الخالي من الفلاش , والعاملين على الويب , ومقابس الويب , وغير ذلك الكثير. لا تزال هذه المعايير معنا حتى اليوم "

Day after day, I see companies break this rule, and it is 100% of the time to their detriment. In this article I will explain what that rule is, and what it means to product and service design. I’ll also raise the possible implications of this phenomenon on organizational management, collaboration, and general performance. The psychological phenomenon I will be discussing in this article is known as Miller’s Law. Rather than just tell you what Miller’s Law is, I ask you to take part in this exercise for a more immersive learning lesson.",

After you are done reading, scroll down until you see the word ‘STOP’. Then, read step 2.",

This capacity for keeping ~7 bits of information ‘in the head’ short term, is known as Miller’s Law.",

        "In 1956 there was a paper written that became one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. Titled, The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information, it was published in 1956 by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Princeton University’s Department of Psychology in Psychological Review. The crux of the paper suggests that the number of perceptual ‘chunks’ an average human can hold in working memory (a component of short-term memory) is 7 ± 2. This is frequently referred to as Miller’s law. Here is a summary of the article, sourced from wikipedia:",
        "Moreover, the human mind can remember ~7 bits of information when completing a task that requires cognitive effort. This is critical, because humans are constantly performing tasks, and trying to juggle various stimuli in the mind when doing so. One of the key concepts behind Miller’s Law is ‘chunking’, which basically means assembling various bits of information into a cohesive gestalt. For example, the word · p e n c i l · is actually a ‘chunk’ of letters, organized into a perceptual gestalt. If the letters were rearranged · c n l i p e · it would be six separate chunks of information. Chunking is a critical element of information organization, and is the basis for our UX and organizational rule.",
        "<h2>The Rule</h2>",
        "The more chunks of information you add to an ‘interface’, the more difficult it becomes to ‘work’, using the information at hand. This is especially critical for first time users, because they haven’t had the ‘practice’ needed to encode the interface into long term memory, or, for the behaviour to become habitual. I constantly see this rule being broken by giants like Facebook, Google, and Wordpress. Don’t even get me started on automobile interface design. The ~5 bit chunk rule also compliments minimalism as a rigorous design philosophy. To expound, due to the limitations of working memory, as a product becomes more feature-full it inevitably becomes more difficult to use, because the user has to manage more information while operating the product. This makes good information design so critical.",
